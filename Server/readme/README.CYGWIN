Rhost does work under windows using the cygwin package.

1.  When you do install cygwin, the following packages must be added:
make
git
gcc
crypt
openssl (optional)
gdbm
bash

2.  The src/Makefile has to manually have the CYGWIN line uncommented.

3.  When you issue Startmush, you must pass it the -cyg option.


Hopefully this gets you working with Rhost.

Good luck.
