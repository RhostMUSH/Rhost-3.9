MySQL is now native in RhostMUSH as of 3.9.5p2.

*******************************************************************************
** IMPORTANT ** IMPORTANT ** IMPORTANT ** IMPORTANT **IMPORTANT ** IMPORTANT **

To autodetect it, YOU MUST HAVE mysql_config installed and running
on your server.  Without this, even if you have mysql db installed
it won't be able to recognize the parameters you will need for it
and will thus fail.  Please check your linux distribution to see
what packages are needed to install mysql_config.

Download the git repository to a seperate directory so that you can
copy over the files that it requires you to.

Suggestion:  git clone http://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk ~/tmprho

If you are patching UP from an older version, you need to update
the following files:

1.  update your src/Makefile to the one in the 3.9.5p2+ repo
    ( cp ~/tmprho/Server/src/Makefile ~/Rhost/Server/src/Makefile )
2.  update your bin/asksource.* files to the one in the 3.9.5p2+ repo
    ( cp ~/tmprho/Server/bin/asksource.* ~/Rhost/Server/bin/ )
3.  append 'include rhost_mysql.conf' BEFORE the rhost_ingame.conf file
    and before the section that says 'define local aliases' toward the end of
    your netrhost.conf file.
    ( edit your ~/Rhost/Server/game/netrhost.conf file )
4.  copy the game/rhost_mysql.conf file from the 3.9.5p2+ repo 
    ( cp ~/tmprho/Server/game/rhost_mysql.conf ~/Rhost/Server/game/ )
5.  The following lines have to be REPLACED/CHANGED in local.c ( toward the top ):
    ( you may edit this or copy the one from the other distro )
    ( do either:  edit ~/Rhost/Server/src/local.c )
    (        or:  cp ~/tmprho/Server/src/local.c ~/Rhost/Server/src/local.c )

    /* Called when the mush starts up, immediatly prior to the main game

     */
    #ifdef MYSQL_VERSION
       extern void local_mysql_init(void);
       extern int sql_shutdown(dbref player);
    #endif

    #ifdef SQLITE

    #ifdef MYSQL_VERSION
       local_mysql_init();
    #endif
       load_regexp_functions();
    }

    /* Called immediatly after the main game loop exits. At this point
     * all databases and variables are still configured
     */
    void local_shutdown(void) {
    #ifdef MYSQL_VERSION
       sql_shutdown(-1);
    #endif
    }
//----------- IF REPLACING/CHANGING local.c COPY ABOVE --------------------------

6.  Issue 'make clean' then make confsource to rebuild using the latest
    builder script to build in the mysql changes.
