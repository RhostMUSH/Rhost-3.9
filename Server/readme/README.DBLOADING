To load in a previous database, you run the db_load script.

From the game directory you would type:

./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm yourflatfilehere data/netrhost.db.new


******************************************************************************
Please note, you may also do: ./Startmush 

Then you just follow the prompts to load in your flatfile there.
******************************************************************************

If you wish to have #1's password reset to 'Nyctasia' please add this
to the bottom of your netrhost.conf file:

newpass_god 777

The caveat is that you must not have any netrhost.db* or netrhost.gdbm* files
in your data directory prior to loading it in.  It'll error out if previous
files exist.  So you will need to move all files that start with netrhost.db*
and all files that start with netrhost.gdbm* to another directory.

Your flatfile tends to be named 'netrhost.db.flat' which is in your data 
directory.  You can, however, name your flatfile anything you want and have
it in any directory you want.

To make a flatfile in game, you just issue @dump/flat.  You can specify
a filename after it, otherwise it assumes the name 'netrhost.db.flat'.
