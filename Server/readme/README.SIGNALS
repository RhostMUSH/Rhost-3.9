The following signals can be given to Rhost:


kill -USR1    -- causes RhostMUSH to issue a @reboot
kill -USR2    -- causes RhostMUSH to issue a @shutdown
kill -TERM    -- causes RhostMUSH to issue a panic @dump/flat and immediately exit (no db save)
kill -9       -- this signal can't be caught and usually corrupts the database.  Don't do it :)
