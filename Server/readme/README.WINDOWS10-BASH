Rhost can be compiled and run under the new Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.
This has been tested with the Preview build 14342.

1. After installing Bash you will need to install the following packages:
git
make
gcc
openssl (optional)
libpcre3 (optional)
libpcre3-dev (optional)

2. When configuring rhost (using confsource) select the Disable Debugmon 
option.

3. When you issue Startmush, you must pass the -cyg option.


Hopefully this gets you working with Rhost.

Good luck.
