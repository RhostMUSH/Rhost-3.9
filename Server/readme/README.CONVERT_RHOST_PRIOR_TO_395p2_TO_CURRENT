Ok.

So you're running an old RhostMUSH.

One prior to 3.9.5p2 and want to take advantage of the new
format of the Makefile and the automated mysql stuff and
all the other goodies that isn't really (easilly) done
with just patch.sh.

Well, you're in luck.  It is actually fairly easy to do.

This is what you have to do.

First thing's first.

1.  Log into your existing mush.  Let's make current backups
    of all your flatfiles.  Issue:
    A. @dump/flat
    B. wmail/unload
    C. @areg/unload
    D. newsdb/unload

2.  Shutdown your game (@shutdown)

3.  Make an image of all your current backed up files.  From
    The Server/game directory you would type:
                ./backup_flat.sh -s

    Please remember the '-s' to the ./backup_flat.sh.

4.  Make note of the most recently created file in the directory
    Server/game/oldflat.  It's usually named something like:
                RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz

    You will need this file later.

5.  Rename your 'Rhost' directory to something else.  This
    is the directory that you have containing the 'Server'
    directory.  Name it anything you want other than 'Rhost'.
    For those not used to unix you would type:
                mv Rhost Rhost_old

6.  Pull in the latest Rhost.  You would type:
                git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk Rhost

    You would type this in the same directory you have renamed
    your old 'Rhost' directory

7.  go into the Rhost/Server directory.   Type:
                make confsource

    Select what options you want (including the mysql and other goodies)
    then compile it (also within the menu, it's the 'r' option).

8   Once your game is compiled and ready to go you need to copy in
    the data from your old game.  Copy the RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz
    we mentioned in step #4 to the Server/game directory of your NEW
    GAME DIRECTORY.  From within the 'game' directory of your current
    game you should be able to issue (if you named the old one Rhost_old):
    Again this needs to be done FROM YOUR Server/game directory!!!
    A. cp netrhost.conf netrhost.conf.orig
    B. cp ../../Rhost_old/Server/game/RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz .
    C. tar -zxvf RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz 
    D. Compare your current netrhost.conf to the default one that came with
       the source (that you renamed to netrhost.conf.orig).  Likely the
       only sections you have to add to your current netrhost.conf (that
       came with your RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz archive), will be toward 
       the end, with the include rhost_ingame.conf and rhost_mysql.conf.
       Depending on how old your game is coming from you may need to add
       more options.  Any config option that is the same between the 
       netrhost.conf files do not have to be copied over, and you want to
       keep your custom settings (like don't port or other stuff you 
       have already customized).
    E. ./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm data/netrhost.db.flat data/netrhost.db.new
       This loads in your flatfile information.
    F. ./Startmush  
       Your ./Startmush should re-index all your txt files you originally made.
    G.  In your game type the following as an immortal or as #1.
       1.  wmail/load
           This will load in your mail flatfile.
       2.  @areg/load
           This will load in your autoregistration flatfile (if available)
       3.  newsdb/load
           This will load in your hardcoded bbs flatfile (if available)

9.  You should be good to go on a current directory structure for Rhost.  Enjoy!
