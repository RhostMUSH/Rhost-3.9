All .txt files must be mkindx'd.
The flatfile must be loaded in as a new db
This is a minimal db with basic 'features' built in.

the reimaged.db.flat needs to be loaded in, it's the latest one.
the reimaged.conf file needs to be copied over the netrhost.conf in your game directory.


Steps:

1) copy the netrhost.conf file into the games directory
2) make any relevant changes you wish
3) db_load the flatfile
   - go into the game directory
   - type: ./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm ../minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat data/netrhost.db.new
4) Startmush as expected
