  @mail[/<switches>] <player-list> = <subject>
  @mail[/<switches>] [<msg-list> [= <target>]]
   
  @mail invokes the MUX @mail wrapper. This allows sending and receiving mail.
  Pronoun/function substitution is performed on any messages you may try to send.
   
  A <player-list> is a space-separated list of recipients, which may be:
        Player names, Player dbref #'s, Message numbers to be replied to, or
        A mix of the above, and mail aliases (see @malias)
   
  A <msg-list> is one of the following:
        A single msg # (ex: 3)
        A message range (ex: 2-5, -7, 3-)
        A sender (ex: *lauren)
        A page (ex: p1, p2, etc)
        (n)ew, (u)nread,  (b)oth new/unread, (m)arked, (s)aved, or (o)ld

& mail-sending
  @mail[/switch] <player-list> = <subject>
        This begins a message to all players in <player-list>.
  
  -<text> adds text to the end of the message in progress.
  ~<text> adds text to the beginning of the message in progress.
        Example: -This is a test  (appends text)
                 ~This is a test  (prepends text)
  
  @mail/send (or --)
        This sends the message that is currently in progress.
   
  @mail/cc <player-list> (or @cc)
        This replaces the currect player list with a new one for carbon
        copying. It does _not_ add onto the existing list.
   
  See mail-sending2.
 
& mail-sending2
  @mail/proof     (or @proof)
        This shows you the message that is currently in progress, as
        it would be read by whomever received it.
  
  @mail/edit <old text> = <new text>
        Like @edit, but edits the message in process.  This does not edit
        text that is in the forward/reply.
  
  @mail/abort
        This aborts the message currently in progress, allowing you
        to start a new one.
   
  @mail/fwd <msg> = <player-list> (or @mail/forward)
        This sends a copy of <msg> to all the players in <player-list>.
        The copy will appear to have been sent by you (not the original
        sender), and its status will be "Forwarded". 
        You have to use '--' or @mail/send to send the message.
   
  @mail/quick <player-list>/<subject> = <message>
        Sends <message> to the list of players.  No editor is evoked.
  
  @qmail <player-list>/<subject> = <message>
        Sends <message> to the list of players.  No editor is evoked.
  
  See mail-sending3

& mail-sending3
  @mail/quickforward <msg> = <player-list>
        Quickly forwards a message to a player.  This does not invoke the
        editor.
   
  @mail/reply <msg>
        This replies to the original sender of the specified message 
        and puts you in an editor.  It does not include original text.
        You have to use '--' or @mail/send to send the message.
  
  @mail/replyall <msg>
        This replies to everyone in the specified message and puts you
        in an editor.  It does not include original text.
        You have to use '--' or @mail/send to send the message.
  
  @mail/reply/quote <msg>
        This works like @mail/reply but includes the original text.
        You have to use '--' or @mail/send to send the message.
  
  @mail/replyall/quote <msg>
        This works like @mail/replyall but includes the original text.
        You have to use '--' or @mail/send to send the message.
 
& mail-admin
  The @mail command can also take the following switches:
   
    @mail/xstats [<player>]   --  Mail statistics, read/unread count,
                                  and space usage.
  
    @mail/nuke <player>       --  Nukes the mailbox of the target player.
                                  All mail previously sent by the player will 
                                  be tagged as coming from (NUKED).
  
    @mail/debug               --  Attempts to repair the database.
   
  Only wizards may stats players other than themselves. The mail statistics
  commands are computationally expensive, and thus are subject to "daytime"
  restrictions. They also cost the same as a @find (100 credits).
   
  The /debug switch does sanity checking on the mail database, and may only
  be used by an immortal.   This effectively unloads the database, sanitizes
  it, then reloads it back in.
   
  The /nuke switch destroys targetted player and may only be used by a wizard.
 
& mail-reading
  @mail <msg #>
  @mail/read <msg #>
        This displays messages which match the msg#.
   
  @mail
  @mail <msg-list, but not a single msg #>
        This gives a brief list of all mail in the current folder,
        with sender name, a list of receiving players, subject, and
        message status.
  
  @mail/list [<msg-list>]
        This gives the same list, but with time sent instead of subject.
        The status field is a set of characters (ex: NC-UF+) which mean:
                N = New message
                M = Marked (for clearing) messages
                U = Unread
                F = Forwarded message
                R = Replied to message
                S = Saved message
  
        The opposites of these (read messages, etc.) are indicated with a
        '-' in the status field in that position.
 

& @malias
  Command: @malias
  
  There actually is no @malias command.  However, RhostMUSH does have 
  significant alias compatability.  To set a personal alias, you would
  just set a normal attribute on yourself, and have the contents be the
  list of players (space seperated) you want it to send to.  This can
  be by player name, alias, or dbref#.
  Example:  &MYFRIENDS me=#123 Bob Joe #46  
  
  To then send with this mail alias, you would specify the special 
  moniker '&' before the alias.  
  Example: @mail &myfriends=Hey!
  
  There are also global aliases that you may use.  To display the global
  aliases, you would use the 'mail/alias' command.
  Example: mail/alias
  
  Any aliases that are in the '+' segment, you would use '+' as the moniker,
  while any aliases that are in the '$' segment you would use '$'.
  Example: mail/alias +global1 $global2=howdy!
  
  See Also: help mail alias
 
& mail-folders
  @mail/folder
        This command lists all the folders that you have.  Incoming is
        a built in folder and you are not allowed to modify it.
   
  @mail/folder <folder#|foldername>
        This command sets your current folder to <folder#>.  If you specify
        a null folder, it will assume no folder and show all mail by default.
   
  @mail/file <msg-list>=<folder#>
        This command moves all messages in msg-list from the current
        folder to a new folder, <folder#>.
  
  @mail/create <name>
        This creates a folder by name of <name>.  Must be alphanumeric.
   
& mail-reviewing
  @mail/review <player>
        Reviews the messages you have sent to <player>.  It only displays
        UNREAD messages.
  
  @mail/reviewall <player> 
        Reviews the messages you have sent to <player>.  It shows all mail.
  
  @mail/review <player>=<msglist>
        Reads the messages you have sent to <player>.
   
  @mail/retract <player>=<msglist>
        Retracts (deletes) unread messages you have sent to <player>.
        Specify '+all' for the player if you wish retraction of all players.
 
& mail-other
  @mail/clear [<msg-list | all>]
  @mail/unclear [<msg-list> | all>]
        These commands mark mail in the current folder as cleared or uncleared.
        Mail marked for clearing is deleted when you disconnect, or
        if you use @mail/purge. If no msg-list is specified, all
        mail in your current folder is cleared. If "all" is given instead
        of a msg-list, all mail in *all* folders is cleared/uncleared.
  
        Note: Mail for non-wizards is auto-cleared after a set time.  You will
              need to mark messages with the @mail/safe switch to save them.
   
  @mail/purge
        Actually deletes all messages marked for clearing with @mail/clear.
        This is done automatically when you log out.
  
{ 'help mail-other2' for more }
 
& mail-other2
  @mail/safe [<msg-list> | all>]
        This command marks a message as being safe from mail expiration. It
        should be used sparingly and only for very imporatant messages.
        Each player has 10 save messages total that you may use.  This may
        be bumped up by a wizard if there is sufficient need.
  
        Note: You would use @mail/clear to remove the SAVE flag on the message. 
  
  +clientcfg
        If you have a client like mushclient that auto-emails out, this will
        set it up so it works properly.  Mail wrappers actually @fo the user
        which can, at times, cause scripted mail systems to not function
        properly.  This gets around it by setting the original mail code on
        you so that it may work.

& mail-examples
  Here is an example of mailing a player, where is the player will be "bob",
  and sending the mail.
 
  > @mail bob = The MUX              - This is the Subject line. 
 
  Sending mail to player 'Bob'
  > -Hi bob.                         - This is where you will enter the body
                                       of the message.
  Text Added.
  > @send                            - Basically, sends the @mail.
 
  MAIL: You sent your message to 'Bob'.
