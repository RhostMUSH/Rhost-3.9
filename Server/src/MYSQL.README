This is ALPHA and fairly well tested now.

This is now integrated into RhostMUSH itself.

If you are upgrading to version 3.9.5p2 then likely
you will have to make manual changes to make your
RhostMUSH integrated into mysql as you want.

To do this, please go into your ~/Server/readme directory
and follow the instructions in the README.MYSQL file there.

Thank you.
